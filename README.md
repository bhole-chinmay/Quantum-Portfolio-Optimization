# Quantum-Portfolio-Optimization
This project implements quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization, leveraging modern quantum computing frameworks. It explores how quantum computing can enhance traditional financial optimization techniques by tackling the computational complexity of selecting an optimal asset mix under risk and return constraints

üöÄ Features
Implementation of **Markowitz portfolio theory** using quantum approaches.
‚Ä¢ Utilization of **Qiskit** and related quantum libraries.
‚Ä¢ Comparison between **classical and quantum optimization results**.
‚Ä¢ Demonstrates how **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** and **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** can be applied to financial problems.
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization.

üìÇ Project Structure
‚Ä¢ `quantum_portfolio_optimization.ipynb` ‚Üí Main notebook with implementation, analysis, and results.
‚Ä¢ `requirements.txt` ‚Üí Dependencies for running the project.
‚Ä¢ `docs/` ‚Üí Supporting documentation and references (optional).
